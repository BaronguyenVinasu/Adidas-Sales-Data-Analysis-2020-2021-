# Adidas-Sales-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
This project analyzes Adidas sales data to uncover trends in revenue, profit, sales units, revenue and profit margins across product categories, regions, and sales methods. The analysis includes overview and specific product dashboards with slicers for dynamic filtering.

## Project Objective
Adidas wants to create a sales report for the year 2020 and 2021. So that, the sales department of Adidas can understand their customers and grow more sales in 2022-2025.

## Questions (KPIs)
### Revenue & Profit Trends:
- How does revenue, cost, and profit vary by product category, region, and sales method?
- Which products or regions are driving the highest profitability?
- What are the top-selling products (by units sold and revenue)?
- Which products have the highest/lowest profit margins?

### Sales Channel Efficiency:
- How do sales methods (in-store, online, outlet) compare in terms of revenue and profit margins?
- Is online sales growth outpacing other channels?

### Regional Analysis:
- Which regions contribute the most to total revenue and profit?
- Are there regional preferences for specific product categories?

### Yearly Comparisons:
- How did sales performance change between 2020 and 2021?
- Are profit margins improving or declining over time?

### Cost Management:
- What percentage of revenue is consumed by costs?
- Are certain products or regions disproportionately increasing costs?

## Process
### Data Verification:
- Checked the dataset for missing values (e.g., blank cells in revenue or cost columns).
- Identified and resolved anomalies (e.g., negative values in profit or unrealistic sales figures).

### Data Cleaning:
- Ensured data consistency by standardizing formats (e.g., converting all dates to YYYY-MM-DD).
- Corrected data types (e.g., ensuring revenue and cost columns are numeric).
- Removed duplicates and irrelevant entries (e.g., test data or placeholder rows).

### Data Transformation:
- Created calculated fields for profit (Revenue - Cost) and profit margin (Profit / Revenue * 100).
- Grouped data into categories (e.g., product types: Men’s Apparel, Women’s Athletic Footwear).

### Pivot Table Creation:
Built pivot tables to answer key questions:
- Revenue & Profit Trends: Summarized monthly revenue and profit by product and region.
- Product Performance: Analyzed units sold, revenue, and profit margins by product category.
- Sales Method Efficiency: Compared revenue and margins across in-store, online, and outlet sales.
- Regional Analysis: Aggregated revenue and profit by region (Midwest, Northeast, South, etc.).

### Dashboard Development:

Merged pivot tables into two interactive dashboards:
- Sales Performance Dashboard: Overview of revenue, cost, profit, and trends.
- Product Analytics Dashboard: In-depth analysis of product-specific metrics (e.g., profit per unit).
Added slicers for dynamic filtering:
- Region: Midwest, Northeast, South, Southeast, West.
- Product: Men’s/Women’s Apparel, Athletic Footwear, Street Footwear.
- Sales Method: In-store, online, outlet.
- Years: 2020, 2021.

### Validation & Testing:
- Cross-checked dashboard metrics against raw data to ensure accuracy.
- Tested slicers to confirm dynamic filtering works as intended.

### Visualization & Reporting:
- Designed visually appealing charts (e.g., bar charts for revenue, line charts for trends).
- Highlighted key insights (e.g., top-performing products, regional contributions).
- Prepared a summary report with actionable recommendations.

## Project Insight
- Top-Performing Products: Men’s Athletic Footwear generated the highest revenue($146M), WHhile Women's Street Footwear has the highest average profit per unit ($138M)
- Regional Contribution: The West and South regions contributed 58% of total revenue, making them key markets for Adidas.
- Sales Channel Efficiency: Online sales had the highest profit margin (42%), outperforming in-store (35%) and outlet (28%) sales.
- Year-over-Year Growth: 2021 saw a 15% YoY revenue increase in Women’s Athletic Footwear, driven by online sales.
- Cost Management: 63% of revenue was consumed by costs, leaving a net profit margin of 37%.



## Final Conclusion:
To maximize Adidas’ sales performance, the company should focus on high-margin products like Women’s Street Footwear and Men’s Athletic Footwear, particularly in the West and South regions, which are the top revenue contributors. Additionally, Adidas should prioritize online sales channels, as they offer the highest profit margins and have shown strong growth potential.

A targeted strategy should include:
1.Product Optimization: Increase inventory and marketing efforts for high-margin products.

2.Regional Focus: Allocate more resources to the West and South regions to sustain their strong performance.

3.Digital Expansion: Invest in online sales platforms and digital marketing to capitalize on the 42% profit margin in e-commerce.

4.Cost Control: Identify areas to reduce costs, particularly in outlet sales, where profit margins are declining.

By implementing these strategies, Adidas can enhance profitability, strengthen its market position, and drive sustainable growth.
